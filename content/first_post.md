Summary: A first post for my first static site.

Welcome to my site, denizen of the internet.

What brought you here? That's really none of my business. What will happen here is almost entirely my business.

## A test of H2
This site is the culmination of some strange need to transfer my scribbles from computer paper/ binders to the digital universe. Muttering — verbally breaking wind, more likely — into the void, as it were.

### A test of H3
I guess, what I'm really trying to create, is some motivation to write more. Not really _for_ anyone, other than myself. For some reason, publishing my stupid ideas online... with no real expectation that anyone will ever read them... feels better than putting them in binders... where no one (including me!) will ever read them.

I guess, here, there's a greater possibility that _someone_ will read _something_ here and say, "Hey -- I feel that way, too!"

Aren't we all just trying to connect? Don't we all just desire some basic discourse? Some validation -- that the weird thoughts we're thinking aren't exclusively _ours_?

That's probably the real guts of what's happening here.

Being newly devoid of the onslaught of stimulation (and odd minds) that come standard issue in NYC, I come, hat-in-hand, to the people of the internet, to share with me, this truly insane world we live in.

What do you think?
